  <p><strong>poof</strong> is a one time password sharing service, so you don't email/IM passwords to colleagues/friends/family.


  <p style="font-size:x-large;margin-left:1em;padding:1em;"><a href="send">Share a secret</a></li>


  <p>There's a lot more technical detail on <a href="https://github.com/thechriswalker/poof">Github</a> and the source code is really small, so as to be auditable.
